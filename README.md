- **Lightweight**: Minimal CPU/RAM usage.
- **Legacy support**: Run old IE websites with the LSR releases. They shouldn't work well with modern sites. They could also potentially throw script errors.

## **Versions**
**Qurag 3.2** - uses WebView2, it's a stable release. Recommended for now.
**Qurag 1.1** - uses WebView2, it's a fatal release. Does not launch because of missing DLLs.
**Qurag 1 LSR** - uses IE11, it's a legacy release. No DLLs needed. **This may be insecure!**

## **FAQ**
